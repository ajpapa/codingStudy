      "\n",
      "MODULE REFERENCE\n",
      "    https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/heapq.html\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python\n",
      "    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that\n",
      "    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python\n",
      "    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the\n",
      "    location listed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for\n",
      "    all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,\n",
      "    non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting\n",
      "    property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Usage:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    heap = []            # creates an empty heap\n",
      "    heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap\n",
      "    item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap\n",
      "    item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it\n",
      "    heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time\n",
      "    item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds\n",
      "                                   # new item; the heap size is unchanged\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the\n",
      "      index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less\n",
      "      obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list\n",
      "    without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()\n",
      "    maintains the heap invariant!\n",
      "\n",
      "FUNCTIONS\n",
      "    heapify(heap, /)\n",
      "        Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(len(heap)) time.\n",

      "        Pop the smallest item off the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.\n",

      "        Push item on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the heap.\n",
      "        \n",
      "        The combined action runs more efficiently than heappush() followed by\n",

      "    \n",
      "    heapreplace(heap, item, /)\n",
      "        Pop and return the current smallest value, and add the new item.\n",

      "        This is more efficient than heappop() followed by heappush(), and can be\n",
      "        more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.  Note that the value\n",
